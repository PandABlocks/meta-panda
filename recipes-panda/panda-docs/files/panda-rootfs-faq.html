      <h1>PandA Rootfs Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>How to configure the network statically?</h2>
      DHCP is used by default, a static configuration can be added by writing to
      the file boot.txt in the SD card, for example:
      <pre>
          <code>
              ADDRESS=192.168.0.2
              NETMASK=255.255.255.0
              GATEWAY=192.168.0.254
              HOSTNAME=mypanda
          </code>
      </pre>

      <h2>How to disable sub-net validation in the webcontrol</h2>
      Drop an empty file under state/options in the SD card called
      no-subnet-validation.

      <h2>How to recover from catastrophic changes?</h2>
      Remove the file changes.ext4 from the SD card.

      <h2>How to disable changes being saved between reboots?</h2>
      Replace changes.ext4 in the SD card with an empty file.

      <h2>How to load the full rootfs to RAM at boot time?</h2>
      Drop an empty file called to-ram in the SD card, please keep in
      mind that in some targets(like ZedBoard), this might lead to the server
      failing because the driver cannot allocate enough DMA buffers.

      <h2>What to do if system freezes after loading the FPGA?</h2>
      Drop an empty file called no-fpga in the SD card, the FPGA loader will
      not load the bitstream when this file exists and will allow to try other
      bitstream manually.

      <h2>How to update a running PandA?</h2>
      First delete /boot/packages.squashfs to make sure the new file is not used
      by the mounted rootfs (this step is not needed if you are running rootfs
      from RAM), then scp the new uImage, packages.squashfs, boot.bin, boot.scr,
      system.dtb and target-defs. Finally, reboot the system.

      If you are upgrading from an old PandA firmware, it is important to delete
      the old files first.

      <h2>How to override the FPGA bitstream variant used?</h2>
      By default, the bitstream is selected based on the product name found in
      the FMC EEPROM, if no EEPROM is found, it will default to the no-fmc
      variant.
      This selection can be overridden by setting the variable APP in the file
      config.txt in the SD card, for example: APP=fmc_acq430, this will take
      affect only if the PandA FPGA variant package was installed in the system.
      Some of the PandA FPGA variants that could be available are:
      fmc_acq430, fmc_acq427, fmc_24vio and fmc_lback-sfp_lback.

      <h2>How to authorise a public key for ssh?</h2>
      Add the public key to file authorized_keys in the SD card.
